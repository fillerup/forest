I'm thinking about a multi module directory structure.

First a single module:

/src
/src/main
/src/main/java
/src/main/resources
/src/test/java
/src/test/resources

In the test/resources there are the stories.
I will add:
Test Data

In test/java there are:
Features/Application
Story objects. (Implement the exact text of given/when/then)
Step objects. These seem to represent users. I like this concept.
Page objects.

Unit tests.

I will add:
Simulators (these are copies of the page objects that simulate instead of actually do stuff.)
    A simulator needs another backend. Either another simulator, or a live implementation.



In generated there are:
Mocks
Recorders
